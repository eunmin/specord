# specord

Define record with spec!

## Usage

``` clojure
(require '[specord.core :refer [defspecord]])

(ns my)

(defspecord User [id   integer?
                  name string?])

;; It generates spec for User, id and name like this:
;; (s/def :my.user/id integer?)
;; (s/def :my.user/name string?)
;; (s/def :my/user (s/keys :req-un [:my.user/id :my.user/name]))

(s/valid? :my/user (->User 1 "Eunmin Kim"))
;; true

;; It also makes useful constructors for record like this
;; (defn make-user [m] ...)
;; (defn make-user! [m] ...)
;;
;; This constructors has the ability to validate specs.

(make-user {:id 1 :name "Eunmin Kim"})
;; #my.User{:id 1 :name "Eunmin Kim"}

(make-user {:id 1 :name nil})
;; #:clojure.spec.alpha{:problems ({ ...

(make-user! {:id 1 :name nil})
;; An exception occurred with ExceptionInfo.
```
