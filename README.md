(ns my
  (:require [specord.core :refer [defspecord]]))

(defspecord User [id   integer?
                  name string?])

;; It generates spec for User, id and name like this:
;;
;; (clojure.spec.alpha/def :my.User/id integer?)
;; (clojure.spec.alpha/def :my.User/name string?)
;; (clojure.spec.alpha/def
;;   :my/User
;;   (clojure.spec.alpha/keys :req-un [:my.User/id :my.User/name]))
;; (clojure.spec.alpha/fdef
;;   ->User
;;   :args
;;   (clojure.spec.alpha/cat :id integer? :name string?)
;;   :ret
;;   :my/User)
;; (clojure.spec.alpha/fdef
;;   map->User
;;   :args
;;   (clojure.spec.alpha/cat :m :my/User)
;;   :ret
;;   :my/User)
;; (defrecord User [id name])

(s/valid? :my/User (->User 1 "Eunmin Kim"))
;; true

(require '[clojure.spec.test.alpha :as stest])

(stest/instrument `->User)
